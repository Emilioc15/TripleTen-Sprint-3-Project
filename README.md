# TripleTen-Sprint-3-Project
📞 TripleTen Sprint 3: Statistical Data Analysis — Megaline Plans
📝 Project Overview

This project applies statistical data analysis (SDA) techniques to a real-world business problem at Megaline, a telecom operator offering two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate.

The goal is to analyze customer behavior and determine which plan generates more revenue, helping the commercial department make informed decisions about advertising budget allocation.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on 500 Megaline customers and their activity during 2018, including:

Customer demographics and location

Prepaid plan type (Surf or Ultimate)

Monthly call duration

Number of text messages sent

Internet usage

📌 Billing Rules

Calls are rounded up to the nearest minute per call

Internet usage is rounded up to the nearest gigabyte per month

Text messages are charged individually

These rules directly affect monthly revenue calculations.
